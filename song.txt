Quantum hypothesis leading those mystical superpositions to man's contemplation
We afford deviation and elevate ourselves for science and progress
Unresolved quests
Wisdom is waiting amongst us for conceptual diagrams to be revealed
As concrete designs, we push harder
Search deeper and fear of never to find an answer
Man has infused for centuries its chronicle invasions with monuments
Advocating divinity and immortality for the ancients
Spectral forces will remain from the dead and lost souls
As concrete designs, we push harder
Search deeper and fear of never to find an answer
But as far as weâ€™re alive, we're all part of this experimentation for discovery
Searching the cure and key to the unknown
Waiting for this frightening light to scan all forethoughts
The weakness is about to emerge
