Quantum hypothesis leading those mystical superpositions to man's contemplation
We afford deviation and elevate ourselves for science and progress
Unresolved quests
Wisdom is waiting amongst us for conceptual diagrams to be revealed
As concrete designs, we push harder
Search deeper and fear of never to find an answer
